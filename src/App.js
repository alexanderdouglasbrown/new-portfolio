              Built in my Internet Application Design and Development class using Node.js with Socket.IO.
              I made the drawing pad, which keeps packet sizes small by sending the artist's mouse movements to other players.
              I also worked on the client and server game logic, including assigning the host player, scanning the chat room for correct guesses, etc.
