                Hi, my name is Alex. I'm passionate about computers and technology, and have been programming, building, and repairing computers for as long as I can remember.
                I have a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science from San Francisco State University, and an Associate in Science in CIS Desktop Networking from College of Marin.
                Below are some of my programming projects.

                Built in my Internet Application Design and Development class using Node.js with Socket.IO.

                I also worked on the client and server game logic, including assigning the host player, scanning the chat room for correct guesses, etc.
